// Programm illustrate  the concept of Overriding Method


/*		Overriding  and Overloading

   1.. Overriding will take place only when a method in a subclass and 
	   the corresponding method in super class have same signature
	   ,they should have the same return type , otherwise compiler will generates error
   2.. Overriding is different from overloading 
		-- In case of overloading , two method in a class have same signature
   3.. In the case of Overriding , two method decclared in two different classes have the 
		same signature . They also have the same return type.
   4... In overriding public type method can be overrriden by anather public type method  
	   , this is importent			*/
