/*   WRAPER CLASSES IN JAVA ==

-- Java Uses primitive data types such as int, char , double , 
    which doesnot come under hirarchy of objects
-- These DataType cannot be called by refrence
-- There could be a situation in which we need to use primitive data type as a objects
-- Java Provides wrapper class in order to use these primitive datatype as objects,
    which encapsulates the primitive datatype within an object
-- So Every primitive datatype has a corresponding class defined in java API class library

Primitive Type			Wrapper Class
int					Integer
short					Short
long					Long
byte					Byte
float					Float
double				Double
char					Character
boolean				Boolean

			The Following line of code Extracting the value within the object , this feature known as Unboxing.
