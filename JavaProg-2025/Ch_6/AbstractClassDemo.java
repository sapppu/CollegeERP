// Programm illustrate  the concept Abstract Class

/* A class for which we can not create object is called as an abstract class
   . An abstract class is to be extended and then instantiated
   Abstract class contains abstract as well as non-abstract methods
   
   Some of the method in an abstract class should be declare as abstract . 
   such abstract methods  consist of a method declaration without any body 
   as shown in below example  */

/* All abstract methods that are declare in an abstract class should be 
   implemented by the class that extends this abstract class .
   Otherwise , that subclass itself should be declare as abstract. */

/* A class that can be instantiated is known as Concrete class. 
   Therefore Subclasses of an abstract class , They all are Concrete class */

/* Create a class called as Computercenter declare it as abstract class ,
   define abstract method called as computerNo in that class and 
   then define anather two different calss (Center 1 and Center2) and
   then define main class called as Abstractclassdemo and then
   find / calculate no. of computers present in each center */
