// Programm illustrate  the concept of Final class Concept


/*		
		A class that declared as final modifier cannot be extended
		This meanse such class can not have subclass
		i.e the method in such a class cannot be overrriden
		
		The abstract and final keyword are mutually exclusive.
		Therefore a classs can be either abstract or final but not both.


		Syntax ==

				final class classname
